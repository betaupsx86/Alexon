# Alexon
This is my attempt to embed Alexa Voice Services into the Intel Edison as part of a wearable I’m developing. This is based on the alexa-avs-sample-app available in github but using Yocto to build the linux image and required packages. Currently I’m trying to implement it exactly as stated in the guide, but the final product will of course not have the graphical components of the Java client since the Edison is meant to work as a headless system. To circumvent this, I’m currently using x11 forwarding which must be added as a distro feature to poky. I’m currently experiencing issues with the audio playback in Java. There is simply no sound coming from the app when it should give an audio cue once Alexa is ready to hear your request. Both ALSA and PulseAudio reproduce the app’s mp3 files correctly as tested with VLC, but I'm not sure which interface openjdk uses or what is causing the malfunction. I shall report back as soon as I fix this issue!!
